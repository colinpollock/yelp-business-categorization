Yelp Business Categorization
============================

I'm using the Yelp Academic Dataset[1] to play with Keras and TensorFlow. The prediction problem is
to assign categories (like "Restaurant", "Sushi Bar", "Hardware Store", etc.) to Yelp businesses.


Setup
-----
1. Get the data (see section below Data Setup)
2. `$ python3 -m venv .venv`
3. `$ source .venv/bin/activate`
4. `$ pip install --upgrade pip`
5. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. `jupyter notebook --port 8888`
7. Open localhost:8888 in your browser and open to the notebook Categorization


Data Setup
----------
1. Download the Yelp Academic Dataset. Uncompress it and put the individual json files in data/.
2. Get the Yelp category tree and put it in data. Get it from https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/all_category_list/categories.json.
